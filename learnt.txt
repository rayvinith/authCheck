//agar data mongodb se cahiye to req.body use krenge 
agar token se lena ho ya information dusre jagah se to req.header 

practical approach 

 const {email,password}=req.body

 //we have destructure email and password 

 now this emil and pasword will be retreived from our model that we have created 

 so we need to store that accordingly 


 practically:
  const user =  await userModel.findOne({email: email,password:password})


  //new user registeration 

    const newUser = new userModel(req.body)
        await newUser.save()
